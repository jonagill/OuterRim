# Player pack template (Suspects)
### Email this to players who have been assigned a suspect character. Remember to attach or link to their player packet!

Thank you for joining us for The Outer Rim!  You will be playing the role of **[Role Name + Player Name] (e.g. Technician Andy)**.
 
Attached is a document containing the rules of the game and the background information for your character, including your schedule on the day of the murder.  Please take the time to read through this document at least an hour prior to game time at **[game time]**.  You don't have to memorize everything on it, but you should at least have a general familiarity about who your character is to inform your behavior and help construct your alibi during the investigation.  You may also want to print off the document and refer to it in greater detail throughout the investigation.

Additionally, I have attached a second document containing a map of the crime scene and a notes page for tracking information about your fellow suspects. I recommend printing this document off as well so that you can take notes on it throughout your investigation.

To help set the scene, is the full list of characters we will meet on **[game day]**:
* **[Bulleted list of players in Role Name + First Name format]**
 
Let me know if you have any questions!
