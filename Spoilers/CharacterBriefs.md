## Non-Playable Characters
### Richard Inglesias
#### Age: 43  (b. 5/3/1977)

Richard Inglesias is the murder victim, and is not played by any player.

Richard Inglesias was the shift supervisor at The Outer Rim region of the Dizzyland Resort theme park in Anaheim, California. This region of the park is based on the popular Star Fights film franchise. Richard had a reputation for being a casual and easy-going boss, frequently letting minor violations of park protocol slide. This lax approach to discipline extended to Richard's own behavior. He enjoyed partying with his employees on the company dime, and there were rumors that he was dating his subordinates and engaging in other unscrupulous behavior.

Richard had always had a loose relationship with authority. He was born Ricardo Vasquez in Los Angeles in the late 70s, and he fell in with the 8th Street gang at a young age. He was arrested after he accidentally shot and killed a child during a driveby shooting in 1995. Not wanting to spend his life behind bars, Ricardo took a plea deal where he provided information on the leaders of his old gang in exchange for a reduced sentence. Knowing that he had painted a target on his back, he changed his name upon his release in 2006. After taking several odd jobs in the catering business, Richard found himself working in the kitchens at Dizzyland, where he began to slowly work his way up the ladder to the shift supervisor role he held at the time of his death.

## Playable Characters

### The Detective
#### Age: Unknown
#### Lying: 0/3 
#### Content warnings: None
#### *Note: Only play with the detective if you have at least 7 players.*

The Detective is here to help solve the murder and is not considered a suspect in the case.

### The Birthday Person
#### Age: 30 (b. 11/11/1989)
#### Lying: 1/3 
#### Content warnings: None

The Birthday Person is the newest member of The Outer Rim's staff. They were hired to staff the snack cart outside of Lolo's Cantina, but since this is The Outer Rim, that also means playing a fully fleshed-out character in the Star Fights universe. In this case, that means portraying the tentacle-headed alien T'arla Abeen.

Although the Birthday Person had no dramatic background prior to taking this job, playing T'arla has unlocked their passion for the dramatic arts, and they have applied to a prestigious acting program at The Juilliard School.

As their name suggests, yesterday was their 30th birthday, for which Richard prepared a surprise party at Lolo's Cantina to celebrate.

### The Actor 
#### Age: 34 (b. 7/3/1985)
#### Lying: 2/3 
#### Content warnings: None

The Actor has been playing characters at Dizzyland for eight years. For most of that time, they were relegated to demeaning 'fur' roles, portraying animal characters in stuffy, face-covering mascot costumes. Their main solace during this time was engaging in expensive retail therapy, bankrolled by paycheck advances and occasional gifts from their manager and secret boyfriend, Richard Inglesias.

The Actor's big break came when Richard was made shift supervisor of The Outer Rim, where he used his influence to land them the desirable role of Dango Jett, the helmeted Mantanorian bounty hunter badass. However, all is not well in The Actor's life, as Richard's romantic attention has recently drifted elsewhere.


### The Bartender
#### Age: 29 (b. 2/15/1990)
#### Lying: 2/3 
#### Content warnings: None

The Bartender works at Lolo's Cantina, where they dress up as a famous smuggler and mix brightly colored cocktails for guests all day. It's a hectic job, made all the more hectic by the "secret menu" they cooked up with Richard. The "secret menu" is simple -- The Bartender procures and sells drugs to park guests, while Richard makes sure that park management doesn't catch on. Together they split the profits, and the Bartender gets to walk away with a nice bonus over the paltry salary that Dizzyland offers them.

Little does the Bartender know that park security is beginning to catch onto their arrangement, and that Richard plans to throw them under the bus the moment things start to get hairy.



### The Shopkeeper
#### Age: 27 (b. 4/22/1992)
#### Lying: 2/3 
#### Content warnings: None

Working at the Outer Rim is a dream come true for the Shopkeeper. They've been a huge Star Fights fan their entire life, and getting to literally work inside the Star Fights universe is better than they'd ever imagined. And if they needed any other reason to come into work every day, they've recently become infatuated with the newest member of the Outer Rim's staff...


### The Technician
#### Age: 32 (b. 10/28/1987)
#### Lying: 3/3 
#### Content warnings: Loss of a family member

Since they were a kid, the Technician has dreamed of becoming an Imagineer, the elite team of engineers and designers who create the rides, the characters, and ultimately the magic of Dizzyland. However, their twin sibling was killed in a drive-by shooting when they were eight years old, after which their family began to slowly fall apart. It was all the Technician could do to graduate high school, put themselves through community college, and eventually land an entry-level position as a maintenance technician at Dizzyland.

For over a year, the Technician worked hard and tried to earn a transfer over to the Imagineers. When it became clear that simply excelling at their assigned tasks would not be enough, they also through themselves into a personal project, designing a new kind of interactive robot that could be used to portray characters and delight guests around the park. This project was nearing its completion when the Technician's life was thrown into disarray once again, this time by the discovery of information linking their shift manager Richard Inglesias to the death of their sibling all those years ago. 

The Technician is the murderer, and will therefore have to lie more than any other player. Make sure you assign this role to someone with a good poker face!


### The Security Guard
#### Age: 42 (b. 1/7/1977)
#### Lying: 2/3
#### Content warnings: None

The Security Guard is in charge of enforcing the rules and maintaining the peace around the Outer Rim. Because of this, they have frequently butted heads with shift supervisor Richard Inglesias, who saw rules and regulations as something that only other people need to care about.

Richard seemed to honestly delight in breaking rules and challenging the Security Guard to find some way to prove he was involved, but they always came up short. They thought they finally had the upper ground when they wrote Richard up canoodling with one of his direct reports on park property. However, Richard quickly got his own back -- the Security Guard was recently suspended for eight weeks following an anonymous complaint that they had been been getting inappropriately handsy with the guests. And while they don't have any proof that Richard sent in that complaint, it has his name written all over it.
